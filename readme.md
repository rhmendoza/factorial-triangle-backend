Create a new nodejs project from scratch, create the following routes: 
- Create a GET method to receive a number a calculates the factorial of this number received as http param.
- Create a POST method to receive the height and the base values of a triangle, then make the calculation of their Area.
- Add some unit tests 

General Considerations:
- Please make sure that your result don't use an exponential representation.
- You can use postman (or a similar tool) to test your results.
- You can use google to investigate a little bit about how do the calculations.
